2) Draw a neat diagram of a cell and explain its function.

==> Here is a diagram of a typical animal cell:

[Diagram of animal cell]

Cell membrane: The cell membrane is a thin, flexible barrier that surrounds the cell and separates the inside from the outside environment. It is made up of lipids and proteins and plays a key role in regulating the movement of substances into and out of the cell.

Nucleus: The nucleus is a large, spherical structure that contains the cell's DNA. It is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nucleus plays a central role in the cell's metabolism and controls the cell's activities through the genes it contains.

Cytoplasm: The cytoplasm is the gel-like substance that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles. It is made up of water, salts, and various organic molecules. The cytoplasm is where many of the cell's chemical reactions take place.

Mitochondria: The mitochondria are small, rod-shaped organelles that produce energy for the cell. They are located in the cytoplasm and are responsible for converting the energy stored in glucose into a form that the cell can use.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of flattened tubes and sacs that is found in the cytoplasm. It has two main types: the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The RER is studded with ribosomes, which are involved in protein synthesis, while the SER is involved in the synthesis and transport of lipids.

Golgi apparatus: The Golgi apparatus is a stack of flattened membranous sacs that is also found in the cytoplasm. It plays a key role in sorting, modifying, and transporting proteins and other molecules within the cell.

Lysosomes: Lysosomes are small, spherical organelles that contain digestive enzymes. They play a key role in breaking down and recycling waste materials within the cell.

Peroxisomes: Peroxisomes are small, spherical organelles that contain enzymes that detoxify harmful substances and break down fatty acids.

Vacuoles: Vacuoles are large, fluid-filled sacs that are found in plant cells and some animal cells. They play a variety of roles, including storing water and other substances, helping to maintain the shape of the cell, and participating in the transport of materials within the cell.

Chloroplasts: Chloroplasts are only found in plant cells and certain other organisms. They are the site of photosynthesis, the process by which plants use light energy to produce glucose. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, the pigment that gives plants their green color.

3) How the potential is generated in the human body? Explain action potential with a neat diagram.

==> The human body generates potential difference, or voltage, across the cell membrane of nerve and muscle cells through a process called action potential. Action potential is a rapid change in the membrane potential of a cell that occurs when it is stimulated by a chemical or physical stimulus.

The action potential is initiated when the stimulus activates specific ion channels in the cell membrane, causing ions to flow into or out of the cell. This creates a local change in the membrane potential that can spread from one end of the cell to the other, generating a wave of depolarization.

Here is a diagram that illustrates the process of action potential in a nerve cell:

[Diagram of action potential]

Resting state: At rest, the cell membrane is polarized, meaning that there is a difference in electric charge between the inside and the outside of the cell. The inside of the cell is negatively charged compared to the outside, and the resting membrane potential is around -70 mV.

Stimulus: When the cell is stimulated, either chemically or mechanically, specific ion channels in the membrane are activated. These channels allow ions to flow into or out of the cell.

Depolarization: The influx of ions causes the membrane potential to become more positive, a process called depolarization. When the membrane potential reaches a critical threshold, around -55 mV, it triggers the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, which allow a sudden influx of sodium ions into the cell.

Action potential: The rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane potential to become more positive and triggers the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, which allow potassium ions to flow out of the cell. The combination of sodium and potassium ions flowing in opposite directions creates an action potential, which is a rapid and brief change in the membrane potential.

Repolarization: After the action potential has been generated, the ion channels close and the cell begins to repolarize. Potassium ions continue to flow out of the cell, and the cell's membrane potential returns to its resting state.

Refractory period: After the action potential, the cell enters a refractory period, during which it is unable to generate another action potential. This is because the ion channels need time to reset before they can be activated again. The duration of the refractory period depends on the type of cell and the specific ion channels involved.

Overall, the action potential is a rapid and highly organized process that allows cells to transmit electrical signals over long distances. This process plays a key role in many physiological functions, including the transmission of nerve impulses and the contraction of muscles.


4) Explain cardiovascular system with neat diagram. Name few diseases of CVS.

==> The cardiovascular system is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. It is responsible for pumping and transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other substances throughout the body.

Here is a diagram of the cardiovascular system:

[Diagram of the cardiovascular system]

The heart is a muscular organ located in the chest that pumps blood through the blood vessels to the rest of the body. It has four chambers: the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles. The atria are the smaller upper chambers of the heart that receive blood from the veins. The ventricles are the larger lower chambers of the heart that pump blood out of the heart and into the arteries

The cardiovascular system is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. It is responsible for pumping and transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other substances throughout the body.

There are two types of blood vessels in the cardiovascular system: arteries and veins. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the tissues, while veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. The arteries and veins are connected by smaller blood vessels called capillaries, which allow for the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products between the blood and the tissues.

The blood is responsible for carrying oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other substances throughout the body. It is made up of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets, which are important for blood clotting. The blood is pumped through the body by the heart, and it travels through the blood vessels to reach all the tissues and organs of the body.

The cardiovascular system plays a vital role in maintaining the health of the body. It helps to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, removes waste products from the body, and helps to regulate body temperature and pH. Dysfunction or disease in the cardiovascular system can lead to a range of serious health problems, including heart attacks, strokes, and organ damage.

Some common diseases of the cardiovascular system include:

Coronary artery disease: This is a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrow or blocked, reducing the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle.

Heart failure: This occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

Hypertension (high blood pressure): This is a condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is consistently too high.

Cardiac arrhythmias: These are abnormalities in the heart's rhythm that can cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly.

Atherosclerosis: This is a condition in which the arteries become clogged with plaque, a fatty substance made up of cholesterol, cellular waste, and other substances.

Stroke: This is a medical emergency that occurs when the blood flow to the brain is disrupted, resulting in damage to brain cells.



5) What are the major system of human body? Write about human nervous system and function.

The human body is made up of several major systems, each of which has a specific function. These systems include the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the digestive system, the musculoskeletal system, the endocrine system, and the nervous system.

The nervous system is the body's electrical wiring. It consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and a network of nerves that reaches every part of the body. The nervous system is responsible for sending, receiving, and processing sensory information. It is also responsible for controlling the body's movements and coordinating its functions.

The nervous system has two main components: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord, and it is the body's control center. It receives and processes information from the senses and sends messages to the muscles and organs to initiate action.

The PNS consists of all the nerves that lie outside the brain and spinal cord. It carries messages to and from the CNS and the rest of the body. The PNS is divided into two parts: the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary movement, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and sweating.

The nervous system is crucial for maintaining homeostasis, which is the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment. It does this by constantly monitoring the body's internal and external environments and making adjustments as needed.

In summary, the nervous system is a complex network of cells and tissues that plays a vital role in the body's ability to communicate, move, and maintain homeostasis.


or

The human body is made up of several organ systems that work together to keep the body functioning properly. These systems include:

The circulatory system: This system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. It is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the cells and remove waste products.

The respiratory system: This system includes the lungs, trachea, and bronchi, and is responsible for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body.

The digestive system: This system includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus, and is responsible for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients.

The urinary system: This system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, and is responsible for filtering waste products from the blood and eliminating them from the body.

The skeletal system: This system consists of bones and joints, and provides support and protection for the body.

The muscular system: This system consists of muscles and tendons, and is responsible for movement and support.

The endocrine system: This system consists of glands that produce hormones, which help regulate various functions in the body, including metabolism, growth, and development.

The immune system: This system protects the body against illness and infection.

The nervous system is another major system in the human body. It is responsible for transmitting information throughout the body and coordinating the body's responses to internal and external stimuli. It consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and a network of nerves that extend throughout the body.

The brain is the center of the nervous system and is responsible for controlling all of the body's functions. It receives input from the senses (such as sight, sound, and touch) and processes this information to generate appropriate responses. The spinal cord is a long, delicate tube of nerve tissue that runs from the brain down through the center of the back. It carries messages between the brain and the rest of the body.

The nervous system can be further divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord, and the PNS consists of the nerves that extend throughout the rest of the body. The PNS is divided into the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary movements and sensory input, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions, such as heart rate and digestion.

Overall, the nervous system plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis in the body and enabling the body to respond to its environment.
